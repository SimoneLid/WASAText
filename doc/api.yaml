  description: |-
    The user is presented with a list of conversations with other users or with groups, sorted in reverse
    chronological order. Each element in the list must display the username of the other person or the
    group name, the user profile photo or the group photo, the date and time of the latest message,
    the preview (snippet) of the text message, or an icon for a photo message. The user can start a new
    conversation with any other user of WASAText, and this conversation will automatically be added
    to the list. The user can search for other users via the username and see all the existing WASAText
    usernames.
    The user can create a new group with any number of other WASAText users to start a conversation.
    Group members can add other users to the group, but users cannot join groups on their own or even
    see groups they aren't a part of. Additionally, users have the option to leave a group at any time.
    The user can open a conversation to view all exchanged messages, displayed in reverse chronological
    order. Each message includes the timestamp, the content (whether text or photo), and the sender's
    username for received messages, or one/two checkmarks to indicate the status of sent messages. Any
    reactions (comments) on messages are also displayed, along with the names of the users who posted
    them.
    One checkmark indicates that the message has been received by the recipient (by all the recipients
    for groups) in their conversation list. Two checkmarks mean that the message has been read by the
    recipient (by all the recipients for groups) within the conversation itself.
    The user can send a new message, reply to an existing one, forward a message, and delete any sent
    messages. Users can also react to messages (a.k.a. comment them) with an emoticon, and delete their
    reactions at any time (a.k.a. uncomment).
    A user can log in simply by entering their username. For more information, refer to the “Simplified
    Login” section. Users also have the ability to update their name, provided the new name is not already
    in use by someone else.
